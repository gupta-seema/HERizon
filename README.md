# 🌐 **HERizon**

### **Safe automation, seamless escalation, and the end of wait times**

HERizon is an enterprise-grade **multi-agent security and automation platform** built with **Azure AI Foundry** to modernize IT operations, eliminate backlog, and empower cybersecurity teams.

It uses intelligent agent orchestration to:

- Detect Shadow IT  
- Automate security actions  
- Score and map risks  
- Streamline access governance  
- Maintain human oversight for high-risk cases  

HERizon brings **speed**, **explainability**, and **enterprise safety** to cloud security workflows.

# 🧩 **HERizon Systems Overview**

HERizon contains **two distinct multi-agent subsystems**, each with its own orchestration logic but unified under one platform.

---

# 1️⃣ **Shadow IT Detection & Automated Remediation**

HERizon’s Shadow IT Detection & Automated Remediation system continuously monitors enterprise environments to identify unauthorized or risky SaaS applications. By combining real-time telemetry from Microsoft Defender with a multi-agent orchestration workflow, it automatically scores, maps, and remediates potential threats. High-risk or ambiguous cases are escalated to human analysts, ensuring that all actions are both fast and safe, while maintaining full compliance and auditability.

### **Shadow IT Pipeline**

| Agent                            | Purpose                                                              |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Defender Data Fetcher**        | Retrieves telemetry from Microsoft Defender                          |
| **SaaS Detection Agent**         | Detects unapproved SaaS usage patterns                               |
| **Risk Scoring Agent**           | Generates risk score (0–100) + severity justification                |
| **Policy Mapping Agent**         | Maps activity to enterprise policies                                 |
| **Automation Agent**             | Executes safe, reversible remediation                                |
| **Human Security Analyst Agent** | Reviews high-risk or ambiguous events                                |
| **IT Shadow (Orchestrator)**     | Manages the complete Shadow IT workflow                              |

This enables fast, automated, compliant responses to potential threats.

# 2️⃣ **Access Management Agent Suite (AMAS)**

AMAS automates software access provisioning using 8 coordinated agents.

### **AMAS Capabilities**

- Chatbot-based access requests  
- Role & policy-aware approval decisions  
- License and seat management  
- Duplicate-tool detection  
- Immutable audit logs  
- Automated provisioning through Azure AD (Entra ID)  
- Escalation for high-risk / policy exceptions  

### **AMAS Pipeline**

| Agent                         | Responsibility                                                                                   |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Role Classification Agent** | Maps job title + department → role category                                                      |
| **Risk Assessment Agent**     | Evaluates whether the tool fits the user's role; flags high-risk requests                        |
| **License Agent**             | Verifies seat availability                                                                       |
| **Knowledge Agent**           | Checks for duplicate tools already accessible to the user                                        |
| **Audit Agent**               | Writes immutable logs to CosmosDB                                                                |
| **Automation Agent**          | Grants/revokes access via Azure AD (Entra ID)                                                   |
| **Escalation Agent**          | Sends exceptions to managers via Logic Apps                                                     |
| **Main Orchestrator Agent**   | Connects all agents and controls full decision workflow                                          |
